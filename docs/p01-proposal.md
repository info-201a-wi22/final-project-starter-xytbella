|Abstract | Our main question is what is the change of rank from several days in April to a year. This question is important because we would like to calculate out how the rank changed. To address the question, we will follow the chart and find the difference. Consider that producer shoudl know about their changes of ranking and the popular level.   |
|Keywords | Movie shows, Communication, Rank |
|1.0 Introduction | This is a project about Netflix movie top 10 rank that shows in April 1th, 2th, and 3th. The dataset have variables include the year to date rank, last week rank, title, and date. From the percentage visualization, we can see that the raise and drop of the level can also be presented in the plot, which is a convenient way. Through this dataset, we can figure out the question about the change of rank.  |
|2.0 Design Situation | I do this assignment as a personal assignment, so some parts will be more simplized than others work including more people. Audience is the producers and audiences who watch netflix tv shows that they can follow up the popular level to choose whatever they want. The situation is to know about percentage in the change from several days in April to the result of the year. From human value and stakeholders, all people who work as producer they can watch their grade, which is meaningful for them. Also, people creating the dataset not only helped netflix, but also can be used in other TV apps. However, the limitation of the plot is that dataset only including several days in April, but not conclusive enough to show the highest point and lowest point during the year.  |
|3.0 Research questions | The reason behind I concerning about this problem is that standing on the side of audiences, I can find whatever can be refined in this dataset can better help them to make visualization parts the audiences want to see, and whatever beneficial for them.  |
|4.0 The Dataset | Size: only top ten ranked movies are listed above from April 1th to April 3th. Complexity: from the five different variable on the x-axis, we can see the complexity. |
|5.0 Expected Implications | I assume that the change of the percentage of each top 10 movies on the rank will not exceed 50% |
|6.0 Limitations | I need better calculator for solving this question.|
